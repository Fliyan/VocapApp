1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:01,745
Previously on Suits...

2
00:00:01,746 --> 00:00:02,963
You really know him.

3
00:00:03,081 --> 00:00:04,381
I really do.

4
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:06,333
- Never.
- No.

5
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:08,135
Why not?

6
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:10,003
Because you can never go back.

7
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:11,805
Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

8
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:13,284
through Switzerland
and the Caymans

9
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:14,871
before it comes out
on the other side.

10
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,093
You're obligated to report it.

11
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:17,644
I didn't,
and I'm not going to.

12
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:18,679
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,147
Rachel, hey.
Logan and I kissed.

14
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,933
Mike, no.
Please.

15
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,947
When I said that it
didn't matter what I do next

16
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:28,739
because I have you,
I was wrong because we're done.

17
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:30,524
That's your fee
for putting this deal

18
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:31,942
together.
You son of a bitch.

19
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:33,410
You didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

20
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:34,778
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

21
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:36,246
Yep.

22
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:38,415
You cannot take a job
with that man.

23
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,616
What are you gonna
do about it?

24
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,335
I hired Mike Ross
back at the firm.

25
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:43,453
- What?
- You're really gonna drop me?

26
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:44,588
You're damn right I am.

27
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,091
I never want to see you again.

28
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,843
- Are you back here?
- No, no.

29
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:53,714
I'm--stay somewhere for a while.
Mike-

30
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,202
Rachel,
whatever you're gonna say,

31
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:57,184
now is not the time to say it.

32
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:59,386
I'm coming back
to work tomorrow.

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,721
If you can't accept that,

34
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,558
then whatever you were gonna
say to me won't matter.

35
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:09,206
Thought you might need this.

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,624
Thank you.

37
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:14,678
So, the way I see it,
you've got three options.

38
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:18,131
You can wear what you
were wearing last night,

39
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:19,683
you can go back to your place
and change,

40
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:24,187
or you can grab anything
you want from my closet.

41
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,857
Nothing? I thought for sure
you would leap at the chance--

42
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,443
Mike's coming back to work
today.

43
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:30,644
I know.

44
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,298
- What am I gonna do?
- You're gonna do

45
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,748
what you've been doing
since the day Mike left.

46
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,150
You're gonna walk into Harvey's
office with your head held high,

47
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:38,445
and you're gonna do your job.

48
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,736
- Mike's job.
- Rachel--

49
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:44,207
I don't know how to be
near him without being near him.

50
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:47,661
I'll tell you how.
Give him space.

51
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,212
I don't want
to give him space.

52
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,214
I want to run to him

53
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,500
and hold him and tell him
that I love him.

54
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:54,668
I know, but, Rachel,

55
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,253
if you try to pull him
towards you right now,

56
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,088
all you're gonna
do is push him away.

57
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:00,340
Trust me.
Let things be.

58
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,725
They'll turn out the way
they're supposed to.

59
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:05,228
You don't know that.

60
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,649
I do know that.

61
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,069
Okay.

62
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:14,521
Rachel, I'm gonna tell you
something I've never told you.

63
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,529
I slept with Harvey.

64
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:26,450
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:27,584
But you told me that--

66
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,586
I know what I told you.

67
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,421
It was once,
and I never would have done it

68
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,874
if we were still
working together.

69
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,842
But then,
he left the D.A.'s office,

70
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,680
and...it happened.

71
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:41,882
And then, the next time
I saw him,

72
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,467
he wanted me to come with him
to the firm,

73
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,135
and I did, and that was that.

74
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:46,887
Would you have wanted
a relationship with him?

75
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,556
I would have wanted to try,

76
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,859
but he wasn't ready.

77
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,729
And if I had pushed him
to be ready,

78
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,743
I would be sitting here
talking to somebody else

79
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:01,618
about somebody I used to work
with a long time ago.

80
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,703
What are you saying?

81
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,956
I'm saying everything turned
out the way it was supposed to.

82
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,574
But you said the reason

83
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,912
that you two never--is
because you can never go back.

84
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,583
I lied.

85
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:24,141
Oh, I'd let you go,

86
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,059
but I was here first.

87
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:28,011
Words to live by
by Harvey Specter,

88
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:30,730
the most selfish man
in the world.

89
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:31,932
Don't mind if I do.

90
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:34,267
Wait a second.

91
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:35,769
What are you
doing here so early?

92
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,187
I always get in this early.

93
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:39,606
You never get in this early,
and I know that for a fact

94
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,692
because this is the time
I get in every single day.

95
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:43,910
You should sleep in once
in a while.

96
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:45,111
It's good for you.
Trust me.

97
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,947
I do it every single day.

98
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,748
It just so
happens that this morning,

99
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,083
I have work to do.

100
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,285
What work?

101
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,454
The Schmoolkinsberg brief.

102
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,957
The Schmoolkinsberg brief?

103
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:58,324
That's what you're going with?

104
00:04:58,426 --> 00:04:59,547
It's not gonna write itself.

105
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,595
I'm taking your name
off the wall.

106
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:04,014
Seriously, I'm here
for the Tokyo markets.

107
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:05,682
Name one Tokyo market.

108
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,968
- The Nikkei.
- Name another.

109
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:11,304
Honda, Toyota, Kia.

110
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:12,522
Kia's Korean.

111
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,234
Yeah, but they're
in the same time zone.

112
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:16,726
Where it is currently dinner.

113
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:18,311
I'm a tired
of this inquisition.

114
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:20,647
This is exactly
why I don't come in this early.

115
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:23,400
And the reason that you're
here this early this morning

116
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,869
is because it's
Mike Ross' first day back.

117
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:27,654
Is it?

118
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,248
Louis,
why are you here so early?

119
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:39,833
I am taking
this Forstman document,

120
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:44,838
and I am burying it
in the bowels of these files.

121
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,307
And then,
I am putting these files

122
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:50,343
deep in the bowels
of our storage.

123
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:51,895
Louis, please stop saying
bowels.

124
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:53,780
Katrina, I don't have time
to give a shit about bowels,

125
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:55,649
'cause after this,
we are starting fresh.

126
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,517
And I don't want to hear about
Gillis Industries, Sean Cahill,

127
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:00,520
Charles Forstman ever again.

128
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:09,829
Well, look who it is,
Bonnie and Clyde.

129
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,331
Just the people
I wanted to see.

130
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:12,699
What do you want, Sean?

131
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,618
To serve you with this.

132
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:18,455
What the hell is that?

133
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:21,374
He wants all files relating to
the Gillis Industries takeover.

134
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:22,590
Oh, I don't want the files.

135
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,127
I'm taking them.
Bullshit.

136
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,713
We have 60 days
to fight that or comply.

137
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:28,265
You want to tell him
or should I?

138
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,934
It's not a subpoena, Harvey.
It's a search warrant.

139
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,186
So you're gonna give me
all the files,

140
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:36,222
or you're gonna head downtown
with these two fine gentlemen.

141
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,774
Okay, Sean.

142
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,442
Have it your way.

143
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,061
You're going to take that hall.

144
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,635
You're going to run
into what appears

145
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,650
to be the mummified remains
of a legal secretary.

146
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:46,232
- Her name is Norma.
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,401
She's gonna limp you
up to the 60th floor

148
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,071
where you will find
30 years worth of files

149
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,123
that haven't been sorted
since the Reagan Administration.

150
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:54,273
Or is it the 56th floor?

151
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:56,242
It could be the 35th floor
for all I know.

152
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:57,243
The point is,
while you're trying

153
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:58,745
to find the Ark of the Covenant,

154
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:01,665
we'll be downtown in front of
a judge blocking this bullshit.

155
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,300
You think the threat
of you getting to a judge

156
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,669
before I find what I want
is gonna get me to leave?

157
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:07,053
Then stay,

158
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:09,251
but who do you think's gonna
get the job done faster?

159
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,225

170
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:57,732
Welcome home, sailor.

171
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,642
You were out to sea a long time.

172
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,611
I was, but now I'm back.

173
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,481
And this place
hasn't changed a bit.

174
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:05,899
Maybe it has.

175
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,400
Is this a new Spinner's album?

176
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:09,652
No, and you know it's not new.
You and Harvey joked about it.

177
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,121
I could have sworn
that was a different one.

178
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:12,878
Said the man
with the photographic memory.

179
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,374
Okay, that doesn't mean
I've seen every album--

180
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:15,965
You have no idea
where to go, do you?

181
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:18,828
- Not a clue.
- Come with me.

182
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,333
Donna, I went to the bullpen.

183
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,668
Some guy with a soul patch
was sitting at my desk.

184
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,587
That's because
it's not your desk anymore,

185
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,506
and you're not cool enough
to pull off a soul patch.

186
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,723
I dispute that.

187
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:32,634
Are you even capable
of growing a soul patch?

188
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,678
I had a goatee
my sophomore year of never.

189
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:37,147
Look, it's not your desk
anymore

190
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:38,648
because you're on the other side
of the bullpen now.

191
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:39,933
Which other side?

192
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,090
The other side. Like,
not the side that you were on.

193
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,353
Towards the door
or away from the door?

194
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:44,521
Which door are you talking
about?

195
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:45,688
Which door are<i>you</i>
talking about?

196
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,533
You know what?
Just shut up and keep walking.

197
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:48,718
You're not here five minutes,

198
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,160
and you're already a pain
in my ass.

199
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:55,415
This is the other side
of the bullpen.

200
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,085
- Are you serious?
- I know.

201
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,420
I fought it tooth and nail.

202
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,921
I mean, if it were up to me,
you'd be setting up shop

203
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,256
in the file room.

204
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:04,874
You did this, didn't you?

205
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,844
Well, I didn't not do it.

206
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,012
Thanks, Donna.

207
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,632
It's good to have you back,
Mike.

208
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,350
Well, some of us have work
to do,

209
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:15,385
and of course,
by "some of us,"

210
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,053
I mean you.

211
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,471
As soon as word got out
that you were coming back,

212
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,440
the partners started
taking numbers

213
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:23,726
to give the boy wonder
their work.

214
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,979
- Thanks, Donna.
- You already thanked me.

215
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,314
Not for that.

216
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:29,616
For not mentioning Rachel.

217
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,034
- Mike--
- Come on.

218
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:34,320
You expect me to believe
you don't know what's going on?

219
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:37,323
I know enough to know
that it's between you and her.

220
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:50,420
Shit.

221
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:51,754
Look who's back.

222
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:55,091
Shit, look who's still here.

223
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,676
Somebody had to pick up
your slack

224
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,845
while you were shiting the bed
on Wall Street.

225
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,980
Which is why it's good to be
back here where there's a shity

226
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:03,933
lawyer like you
to make me look good.

227
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,602
It's good to see you.

228
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:06,736
Thanks, Katrina.

229
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,738
Don't thank me.
Thank Louis.

230
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,857
Oh, I did
when he hired me back.

231
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:13,993
I'm sure you did, and I'm sure
he would never tell you this,

232
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:18,364
but I wanted you to know what he
gave up to bring you back here.

233
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,950
- What are you talking about?
- Jessica gave Louis one wish

234
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,335
when he closed Forstman,

235
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,954
and he had a whole plan
to manage his work schedule

236
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,790
so he could try
to reignite things with Sheila.

237
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,543
And he gave all that up
because he cared more about you

238
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,546
than he did about himself.

239
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,967
- I didn't know that.
- Well, like I said,

240
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,003
I thought you should.

241
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,813
Welcome back.

242
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,712
I have court in ten minutes.

243
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:07,664
Now, what are you three doing
in front of my face?

244
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:09,499
We're here because he showed
up at our offices this morning

245
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:10,917
with a search warrant.

246
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,168
A search warrant,
I'm sorry to say,

247
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:13,636
you have no authority to stop.

248
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,505
Yes, you do
because he deliberately

249
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,340
went outside your authority
to get it.

250
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:18,591
- What?
- Your Honor,

251
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,059
I went to a different judge
because my office

252
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,644
tried to reach you,
but you were unavailable.

253
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:23,346
Check with your clerk.
There's a record of the call.

254
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,200
Did you make it
from Judge Franklin's house?

255
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:28,101
Because he's the one who signed
the warrant at 8:30 last night.

256
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,486
The same judge you play golf
with every Thursday.

257
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,022
And Barack Obama plays
basketball with Eric Holder.

258
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,190
Let's arrest everybody.

259
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,192
I'm not interested
in everybody.

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,744
I'm interested in
why you went around me.

261
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:39,334
Because I needed a warrant
last night

262
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:41,497
to stop them from destroying
evidence this morning.

263
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,783
And the day someone's guilty
until proven innocent

264
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,502
is the day that argument
holds an ounce of water.

265
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,087
Better get your glass, Harvey.

266
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,589
That day's coming
sooner than you think.

267
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,541
Well, it's not today.

268
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,905
I'm revoking your search warrant

269
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,206
until we can have
a full hearing.

270
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:55,611
- Your Honor--
- Now, that's enough.

271
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:58,598
If you want to go rummaging
around in a law firm's files,

272
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,100
you better come to me
with more than innuendo.

273
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:05,805
I better get going.

274
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,640
I have to look up
the word "innuendo,"

275
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:12,228
if you know what I mean.

276
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:15,231
Harvey, I'm telling you, that
man is not going to stop coming.

277
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,867
I'm going to suggest
something radical here.

278
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,319
And what is that?

279
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:21,571
We could just give him
what he wants.

280
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,289
The fact is
we've got nothing to hide.

281
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,575
Harvey, I don't care
that we have nothing to hide.

282
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,377
A police officer
follows a car long enough,

283
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,828
he's gonna find
a busted taillight.

284
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:31,497
And even if he doesn't,
he's gonna bust it himself.

285
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:32,715
Well, what are you
suggesting we do?

286
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,584
I don't know,
but this whole witch hunt

287
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:37,337
is about Cahill thinking
you colluded with Mike Ross.

288
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:38,471
So now that he's back,

289
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:40,173
why don't you collude
with that fraud

290
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:42,175
and get us the hell
out of this?

291
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:50,644
See you got yourself
an office.

292
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,027
Yeah, it's not as nice
as the one I had, but--

293
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:54,529
It's still a step up.

294
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,815
You mean because it's smaller
or because the view is worse?

295
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,984
I mean
because it's my old office.

296
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,286
You're shiting me.

297
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,954
Look in the top left drawer.

298
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:12,330
- You're serious.
- I am.

299
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:13,581
Donna said she did this.

300
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:15,700
She had the idea
to give you an office.

301
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,385
It was my idea
to give you this office.

302
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:18,816
And it just
happened to be empty.

303
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:19,921
Something like that.

304
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:21,840
Right.

305
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:24,809
It's good to have you back
where you belong.

306
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,594
Okay, enough fun.

307
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,513
Sean Cahill's trying
to go through every file

308
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,348
we have on the takeover.
You in?

309
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,066
I sure as hell
don't want to do an amicus brief

310
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:33,685
for Paul Porter.
Good.

311
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:35,270
Then figure out a way
to keep Cahill

312
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,771
from getting his hands
on our documents,

313
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,857
and do it fast
because we don't have much time.

314
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,575
Harvey, have you considered

315
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,777
the fact that he's been
going after us for collusion,

316
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,096
and we didn't collude?
What are you getting at?

317
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,165
Why don't we just give
him all the files?

318
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,266
We have nothing to hide,

319
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,784
and fighting him makes it
look like we do.

320
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,079
That's what I said
to Jessica.

321
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
You know what she said to me?

322
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:54,005
"A cop follows a car
long enough,

323
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,540
"he's gonna find
a busted taillight.

324
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:57,675
And even if he doesn't,
he's gonna bust it himself."

325
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,181
Speaking of Jessica,

326
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,603
you never told me how she felt
about me coming back.

327
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:11,606
Find a way to beat Cahill,
and then ask me that again.

328
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,148
You just had to get
to him first, didn't you?

329
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:21,282
What, did you give him a lock
of your hair?

330
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,784
What are you talking about,
Louis?

331
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,486
You think I didn't notice
you conveniently put Henderson

332
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,287
in my old office so you
can give Mike your old office?

333
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,405
For your information,

334
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,492
Louis, Henderson
begged for your old office

335
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,410
because he thinks
you're the best attorney

336
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:33,995
that's ever walked the face
of this earth.

337
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,880
Oh, bull--really?

338
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:38,633
Absolutely.

339
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:41,553
So you're not just saying
that to butter me up

340
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,421
so I'll let this go?

341
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:44,756
Hand to God,

342
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,724
or as Henderson would say,

343
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:48,927
"hand to Louis."
Okay, then.

344
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:53,097
Just as long as you're not
trying to pull one over on me.

345
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:54,899
That Henderson is going places.

346
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:05,076
Don't move.

347
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:06,828
What are you doing?

348
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:09,247
Taking a mental picture
of this moment.

349
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,782
Louis, that's not a mental--

350
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,451
Mike Ross, the prodigal son,
returns.

351
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:14,869
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

352
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:19,374
And Louis, I want to thank
you again for bringing me back.

353
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:20,925
I'm never gonna forget it.

354
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:24,462
And if there is every anything
that I can do to repay you--

355
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:25,964
Mike, please.

356
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:27,181
Don't insult me.

357
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:30,518
You do not owe me,
and if you really care about me,

358
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:34,522
you will never mention
repaying me with a favor again.

359
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,641
- Really appreciate it, Louis.
- Good.

360
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,810
Now, I need you to drop
whatever it is you're doing--

361
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:40,464
Oh, Louis,
I can't drop what I'm doing.

362
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:41,896
Harvey just asked me to--

363
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,064
What do you mean you
can't drop what you're doing?

364
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:44,315
I just brought you back here.
You owe me.

365
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,650
You just told me
never to mention that again.

366
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:47,118
What, do you think
I meant that?

367
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:47,986
I said that because that's
what people say.

368
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,487
Now, what you say is,

369
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:50,572
"screw what Harvey
asked me to do.

370
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:51,623
"I don't give a shit about him.

371
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,180
I only give a shit about you,
Louis."

372
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,375
Louis, this isn't
just for Harvey.

373
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,493
It's for the firm, okay?

374
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:56,744
Sean Cahill--
Bullshit.

375
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,559
That's just the kind of thing
that Harvey--

376
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:00,465
did you just--did you just--

377
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:01,499
did you just say, "Sean Cahill"?

378
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:02,834
Yeah.
He's trying to get access

379
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,168
to our files
on the Gillis takeover.

380
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:06,504
Why didn't you
say that in the first place?

381
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:08,056
We need to fight
this son of a bitch

382
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,340
with the full force
of the law, Mike.

383
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,076
- That's what I was doing.
- Then, do it.

384
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,176
You don't have time
to work on this case.

385
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,262
I need to bring it to Katrina.

386
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,848
- Louis, are you okay?
- No, I am not okay.

387
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,382
Mike, this is an attack
on our firm,

388
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,435
and an attack against one of us
is an attack against all of us.

389
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:22,236
Get the hell to work.

390
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:27,609
We're in trouble.

391
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:29,911
Sean Cahill is trying
to get the Gillis files.

392
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,196
Louis,
you buried that document.

393
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,581
You don't understand.

394
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:35,533
The SEC is gonna have
these files forever,

395
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,348
and eventually,
they're gonna see the money

396
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,020
went in one place
and came out the other,

397
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:42,540
and I'm the person who did it.

398
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:44,042
What do you need me to do?

399
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,511
I want you to cover up
my tracks as best you can.

400
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:47,929
And what are you going to do?

401
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,963
I'm going to try to fix it
so the goddamn thing

402
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:50,765
never happened
in the first place.

403
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,608
What are you doing here?

404
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,894
I didn't think we had
any further business to discuss.

405
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,312
We don't.
We just have a problem

406
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:05,980
with the business we just did.

407
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:07,858
Are you here to shake me down
for more money?

408
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,067
I'm here to give it all back.

409
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,069
- Louis, I told you--
- No, just listen to me, okay.

410
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,238
The SEC--they're trying
to get access to our files.

411
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:17,542
That happens, they see that
your payout was routed offshore

412
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,866
and you didn't pay taxes on it.

413
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,129
They'll see
I haven't paid taxes.

414
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,581
I have until the third quarter
of two years from now

415
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:25,133
to report that income,

416
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:26,751
and if I need to, I will.

417
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,553
Are you crazy?

418
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:29,971
They're not idiots.

419
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:33,057
Nobody has money wired through
a Swiss bank and the Caymans

420
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,093
if they're planning
on reporting it to the IRS.

421
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:37,895
That's not proof of anything,
and the only thing

422
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,981
they'll definitely find if they
get a look at those files

423
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:41,315
is that you embezzled money.

424
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:42,900
So get out of my office.

425
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,102
Listen to me, goddamn it.

426
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:47,989
We need to undo this deal.

427
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,907
I tell you what, Louis.

428
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:54,829
Have a seat.

429
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:57,615
You want peace of mind?

430
00:17:57,783 --> 00:18:01,002
Draw up the same paperwork
we already signed.

431
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:04,422
Only this time, have Harvey
sign it instead of you.

432
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:05,707
What?

433
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:06,708
You're the one
who said you'd go to the ends

434
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:07,759
of the earth
to stick it to him.

435
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,076
Taking his client
is one thing.

436
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:10,094
Framing him for a felony?

437
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:11,129
That's another.

438
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:12,714
It's your call.

439
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:14,348
Use your name,
replace it with his,

440
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:15,850
I don't give a shit.

441
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,854
But the deal
is staying in place.

442
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:39,165
I heard they hired
a new hotshot attorney,

443
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,084
but they never said
how handsome he was.

444
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:42,881
Look, Rachel,
I'm really swamped right now.

445
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,089
Too swamped to even
stop by and say, "hello"?

446
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:48,308
Saying hello is just
gonna lead to saying a lot more,

447
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:51,928
and now is not the time
to have it out.

448
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,847
Well, I'm not here
to have it out with you.

449
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,900
I am here to work with you
on fighting off Sean Cahill.

450
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,151
I don't need any help.

451
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,653
But you just
said you were swamped.

452
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,438
Because I'm trying to avoid
having a conversation with you,

453
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:04,691
which, obviously, isn't working.

454
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:06,943
Well, Mike,
I am Harvey's associate now.

455
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,862
So you working a case with him,
you're working it with me.

456
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,426
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

457
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:12,198
Well, he said it to me.

458
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,119
Why do you think I'm here?

459
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,133
I don't care what he said.
It's not a good idea.

460
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:20,373
What isn't? For us to even be
in the same room together?

461
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,925
Not right now.
No.

462
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:24,044
You're the one
who chose to come back here.

463
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:26,212
So?

464
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:27,597
So you don't get

465
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:29,966
to act disappointed
that I work here too.

466
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,301
Rachel. Listen to me.

467
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:33,119
I told you that I needed space.

468
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:35,388
What do you call
staying in a hotel?

469
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:37,891
Based on this conversation,
I call it a smart move.

470
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,976
Okay, Mike, I'm sorry.

471
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,111
Where are you going?

472
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:42,896
Get some air.

473
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:50,120
Wow.

474
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:52,277
They hire you back after helping
them break the law,

475
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,790
and this is
what they give you for lunch?

476
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:56,268
You wouldn't ask that if you'd
ever had one of these bagels.

477
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,495
Maybe not,
but let me ask you this.

478
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,082
You remember that game show
called Let's Make a Deal?

479
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:03,383
Not interested.

480
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,834
You haven't heard
what's in it for you.

481
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,586
I don't need to hear
what's in it for me because I

482
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,838
know what's in it for you.

483
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:10,173
You're a smart kid.

484
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,530
I see why they wanted you back.

485
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:12,926
I'm gonna get back
to my bagel, which is gonna

486
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,845
taste so much better
when I'm not looking at you.

487
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,933
All right, before you gobble
that up, think about this.

488
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,769
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna get those files,

489
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,771
but there's nothing to stop you
from giving them to me

490
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:26,439
all on your own.

491
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:27,941
If you do that,

492
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,276
any of those files
that say "Mike Ross,"

493
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:34,664
I'll replace with "anonymous
former employee."

494
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:35,698
That would be tempting, Sean,

495
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,501
if I actually had something
to hide.

496
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:47,343
Oh, I do have
one more question, though.

497
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,130
Is Harvey footing the bill?
What?

498
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:52,966
For your room
at the Soho Grand.

499
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,101
That's where you're staying,
right?

500
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:56,269
You should try the Cobb salad.

501
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:59,272
It's out of this world.

502
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:04,727
Guess who just got
propositioned

503
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,362
by a striking blonde?

504
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,648
Please tell me
it was Kate Upton.

505
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:09,899
Isn't she a little young
for you?

506
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,835
Last night, she told me
I was the perfect age.

507
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,153
To be her father.

508
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,954
When are you gonna understand
they all want a daddy, Mike?

509
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:16,322
You want to talk about Cahill
or just

510
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,158
keep bragging about things
that never actually happened.

511
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,460
- What did Cahill want?
- It's not what we wanted.

512
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:21,795
It's what he gave me.

513
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:22,962
Well, let's have it.

514
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,497
Son of a bitch
knew I was staying at a hotel.

515
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:25,799
- What are you getting at?
- Didn't you say

516
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,956
he sidestepped Judge Hopkins
to get a search warrant

517
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:29,002
for our files?

518
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,720
You're thinking
he went around Hopkins

519
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:32,055
to get authorization
to follow us?

520
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,424
I'm thinking he never
got authorization at all.

521
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:35,842
Then we need to get a list

522
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:38,311
of the SEC's requests
for surveillance by tomorrow.

523
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,979
I have a friend at justice.

524
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,681
Since when?

525
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,525
Okay, I don't,
but I thought it sounded cool.

526
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:45,268
Mike, this is serious.

527
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,203
We need that list,
and we need it by tomorrow.

528
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,189
On it.

529
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,081
Good new, Louis.

530
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:02,535
I not only misfiled
and misdated that document,

531
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,705
I added in 10,000 others
that look just like it.

532
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,591
That thing is as buried
as it's ever going to be.

533
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:09,592
What the hell difference
does it make?

534
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:12,212
It's all for nothing.

535
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:15,348
- What happened with Forstman?
- What do you think?

536
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:16,716
He didn't go for it.

537
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:20,220
No, something else happened
because you wouldn't

538
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,472
be this upset
if he just turned you down.

539
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,557
He wouldn't undo anything,

540
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:27,694
but he is willing to let me pin
the whole thing on Harvey.

541
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,229
How could you even do that?

542
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:30,363
Oh, I don't know.

543
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:32,982
Make up a new document,
forge his signature.

544
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,757
Doesn't matter 'cause
I'm not gonna do it.

545
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:37,403
- Louis--
- Katrina, enough.

546
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,122
You did good work,

547
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,991
but the truth is, if we
have to turn over those files,

548
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:43,207
they find that transaction.

549
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,079
I'm gonna end up in prison.

550
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:52,835
Then you and I better

551
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,389
figure out a way to make sure
Harvey wins that motion.

552
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,513
Okay.

553
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,817
Don't you have a funny way

554
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:09,819
of giving someone space.
What?

555
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,689
Not only did you do exactly
what we talked about not doing

556
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,608
but you lied, and you
used Harvey's name to do it.

557
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,493
- I am sorry.
- No, sorry's not good enough.

558
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:20,280
This is the second time we've
had this conversation recently,

559
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:23,950
and I want to know why the hell
we're having it again.

560
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,501
I didn't mean to lie.

561
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,670
I just--I went to Mike to talk--

562
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:29,088
That's my point.

563
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,623
You couldn't even make it
through one day?

564
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:31,841
I thought that I could.

565
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,377
And then, I saw
him sitting there, and I just--

566
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:36,012
Rachel, just because
something's hard to do

567
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:37,547
doesn't mean
that you can't do it.

568
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:39,515
Okay. I shouldn't have
brought Harvey into it,

569
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:42,018
but I am not going to apologize
for talking to Mike

570
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:44,304
because he and I aren't the same
as you and Harvey.

571
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,139
Excuse me?

572
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:48,141
- That didn't come out that I--
- I did not tell you

573
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:49,976
that for you to just
throw it back in my face.

574
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,711
I didn't mean
to throw it in your face.

575
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:55,949
I respect that you let things
take their natural course,

576
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,736
but I want to make things work
with Mike,

577
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,873
and the only way I know how
to do that is to fight for him.

578
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,908
Fight for him all you want,

579
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:07,794
but don't lie about Harvey
ever again.

580
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:35,521
You missing it in here
already?

581
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:38,274
Just passing through.

582
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:40,032
- I lied to you.
- I know you lied to me--

583
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:42,745
Not that.

584
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:47,433
Harvey never assigned me
to your case.

585
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:50,253
I did it
because you left our home,

586
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:51,921
and you came here.

587
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:56,876
And all I can think every time
I look at you is how sorry I am.

588
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:05,397
And the reason
I want you to leave me alone

589
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:09,972
is all I can think
when I look at you is him.

590
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:15,228
Then why did you come back?

591
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:18,898
I was drowning,
and Louis threw me a lifeline.

592
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:21,067
I'm your lifeline, too.

593
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:23,369
A lifeline? You're the one
that threw me overboard.

594
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:26,372
- Mike--
- And why did it have to be him?

595
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:33,463
I don't need you to keep
telling me that you're sorry

596
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:36,466
or to be charming
or anything else.

597
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:43,005
I just need to get that image
out of my head.

598
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:09,919
- Did you get it?
- No.

599
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,837
A little heads
up would have been nice.

600
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:13,539
I don't exactly
have a backup plan.

601
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:15,875
- Well, good thing I do.
- What are you talking about?

602
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,928
It doesn't matter whether we
have proof of our theory or not.

603
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,297
It just matters whether or not
our theory is true.

604
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:22,431
You typed up a fake list.

605
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:24,133
Exactly.
Brilliant.

606
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,384
It would have
been a little more brilliant

607
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,936
if you didn't get here
at the last second.

608
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,494
It wouldn't work if it doesn't
look real, and that takes time.

609
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:30,723
Okay, just give it to me.

610
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,725
I got it.

611
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:39,899
Oh, well, well.

612
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,200
If it isn't the wonder twins.

613
00:26:41,318 --> 00:26:43,202
Form of "douche bag."

614
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,154
Shape of "got you
by the balls."

615
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:46,572
No, no, no, no.
It's got to be an animal.

616
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,491
I don't care
what it has to be.

617
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,244
What that is,
is every surveillance request

618
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,079
from the SEC
in the last three months.

619
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:54,580
Mike, why don't you tell him
what's on there?

620
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:57,416
Oh, he knows what's on there
and what's not on there,

621
00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,719
which would be me and you.

622
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,671
Wait a second,
doesn't that make any evidence

623
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:03,445
he's planning on using today
inadmissible?

624
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:06,175
I believe it would.

625
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,427
Save yourself
the embarrassment, Sean.

626
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:10,930
Withdraw your request
for a warrant, a subpoena,

627
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,098
or anything.

628
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,850
All right.
Let's get this thing going.

629
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:17,153
What are you two doing
at his table?

630
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,906
You want to tell him
or should we?

631
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:23,743
Your Honor, I am formally
withdrawing my request

632
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,111
to go through their files.

633
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,996
Then, why are we all here?

634
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,781
Because I want it to be
on the record

635
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,700
that Logan Sanders requests

636
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,451
the release
of all communications

637
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:34,920
between these two gentlemen
on his behalf.

638
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,622
- What?
- You heard me.

639
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,875
Your Honor, how do we know
that signature isn't fabricated?

640
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,010
Go ahead.

641
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,795
Give Mr. Sanders a call.

642
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:46,465
He'll tell you it's true.

643
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,351
Because unlike you,
he was more than happy

644
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:53,189
to sign the request
in exchange for immunity.

645
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,275
Pending verification
of this signature,

646
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,313
you are to give him everything
he asks for immediately.

647
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,733
Your Honor.

648
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:06,369
I told you I'd get those files
sooner or later.

649
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,372
Guess it's gonna be sooner.

650
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,330
What's that?

651
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,665
It's 50 different ways we can
stop Sean Cahill in his tracks.

652
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,334
- Why did you--
- I told you.

653
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,669
An attack on one of us
is an attack on all of us.

654
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,998
Harvey is my brother, and if
Cahill's coming after him,

655
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:28,224
he is coming after me.
Louis, it doesn't matter.

656
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:29,703
There's nothing
we can do about it.

657
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:30,843
What do you mean there's
nothing we can do about it?

658
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,428
Logan Sanders cut a deal
with Cahill.

659
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:34,480
We have to release
all communications

660
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,982
between me and Harvey on Gillis.

661
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,434
Just between you and Harvey?
That's it?

662
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:39,485
None of the Forstman stuff?

663
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:40,820
That's it.

664
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,238
Thank God.
We're in the clear.

665
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,323
Louis, one second ago, you
said that an attack on Harvey

666
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:45,741
was an attack on you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:46,859
And you just said there's
nothing we can do about it.

668
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:48,778
But that doesn't make
it a good thing.

669
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:50,162
- Doesn't it?
- What are you--

670
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,248
Mike, did you
collude with Harvey or not?

671
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,083
- Of course I didn't.
- That's exactly my point,

672
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,086
so as far as I'm concerned,
this matter is done.

673
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,181
Guess what this is?

674
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,183
Louis, I was never really
a Star Trek fan.

675
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:15,554
It's the resting heart rate
of a happy man.

676
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:16,922
It's over?

677
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,557
We're sending them files,

678
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:21,394
but we're not sending
them our files.

679
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:22,778
I don't understand.

680
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:25,531
Logan Sanders signed a deal,

681
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:27,400
blah, blah, blah.

682
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:30,369
They're not getting
the Forstman document.

683
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:32,154
And that's the end?

684
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,740
- That's the end.
- Congratulations, Louis.

685
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:39,245
Thank you, Katrina.

686
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,880
You know what,

687
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:42,331
why don't take the rest
of the day off and check out

688
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,632
that Mummenschanz retrospective
I've been telling you about.

689
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:46,335
Thank you, Louis,
though I may do something else.

690
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,553
Suit yourself,
but I'm telling you right now.

691
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:49,422
It's a game changer.

692
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,424
They--

693
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:01,400
Am I to understand
Logan Sanders waived privilege?

694
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:03,352
- Yeah, it's his right.
- Goddamn it, Harvey.

695
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:05,855
You never should have cut
that man loose as a client.

696
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,190
Well, I cut him loose because
I knew he was the kind of person

697
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:09,575
who would do what he just did.

698
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,277
Bullshit.
You cut him loose

699
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,291
because you knew Mike Ross
was coming back here.

700
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:14,330
Well, you're damn right I did.

701
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,781
I'm not gonna apologize for it.

702
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,783
You should have
discussed it with me first.

703
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:21,120
Well, it's easier to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

704
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,788
Forgiveness?

705
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,757
You just said you're not
going to apologize for it.

706
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:27,426
You know what? I'm not because
I don't want to hear a lecture

707
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:29,464
on the amount of billings
his company brought in.

708
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:32,631
You mean the $20 million
going back over two decades.

709
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,467
I don't give a shit
if it's $100 million.

710
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,936
You want to have it
out over which clients we keep,

711
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,053
I'm happy to.

712
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:39,722
But in this case,
I made a call,

713
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:41,223
and you're either gonna back
me or you're not.

714
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:42,858
We need to stop fighting.

715
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,009
Excuse me?

716
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,544
- We're not fighting.
- Yes, we are.

717
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:46,979
I'm not talking about you two.

718
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,231
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

719
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:50,983
Cahill.

720
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,117
You want us to give in?

721
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:55,821
No. I'm saying
he wants all the files,

722
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,824
let's give him all the files.

723
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:16,747
Rachel,
what are you doing here?

724
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:18,115
I told you needed some time.

725
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,751
And then you told me that you
needed to get that image

726
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,419
out of your head.
Which is why I need-

727
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:26,340
No.
No, it isn't

728
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:30,344
because you'll never completely
get it out of your head.

729
00:31:32,347 --> 00:31:36,467
- Tess.
- Yes, Tess.

730
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:38,135
And my image isn't made up,

731
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:43,190
and it wasn't of two people
kissing.

732
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:45,359
But I got over it
without getting rid of it

733
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,146
because forgiveness
doesn't work that way.

734
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,149
You knew how I felt about him.

735
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:55,486
You knew what it would do to me,

736
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,820
and you did it anyway.

737
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:59,823
And I told you
I made a mistake.

738
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:04,995
What do you want from me,
Rachel?

739
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,831
I want you to decide

740
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,719
if you love me
more than you hate what I did.

741
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,508
And if you don't,

742
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:19,282
then I want you to tell me
that it's over.

743
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:23,847
And if you do,
then I want you to come home.

744
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,706
- Afternoon, Sean.
- Well, you're in a good mood

745
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,341
for a man who keeps getting
his ass kicked.

746
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:53,877
Well, at a certain point,
you get tired of fighting.

747
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:55,012
Well, I wouldn't know,

748
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:56,407
but after this,
we can grab a beer,

749
00:32:56,431 --> 00:33:00,184
and you can tell me
what it's like to be a loser.

750
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:01,468
Your Honor.

751
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:02,719
Mr. Specter,

752
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:05,639
you better be here
to hand over your clients files.

753
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:07,558
I'm here to do more than that.

754
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:10,110
We're handing
over all of the files

755
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:11,862
in the Gillis Industries
takeover,

756
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:14,648
but I want the court to catalog
every piece of paper

757
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:17,401
in there so Sean doesn't "find
one" that was never there

758
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:18,986
in the first place.

759
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,739
Isn't this what you were
arguing against from day one?

760
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:25,492
We changed our minds
because we have nothing to hide.

761
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,244
No, no.
This is a ploy.

762
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:29,898
He's trying to get me on record
stating that we have everything,

763
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,498
and if I find nothing,

764
00:33:31,616 --> 00:33:33,917
he's gonna file
malicious prosecution charges.

765
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:37,170
Actually, Sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

766
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:39,923
And when you don't find anything
in the contents

767
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:42,092
of everything you ever asked
for, this bullshit

768
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,727
search becomes Exhibit A.

769
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:46,230
Your Honor, he has no basis
to file that action.

770
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:47,898
I can't stop the man
from giving you

771
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:52,102
exactly what you were in here
asking me for two days ago.

772
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:55,772
Now, are you gonna proceed under
threat the malicious prosecution

773
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:58,942
or not?

774
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:00,327
What's the matter, Sean?

775
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:02,613
Afraid you won't find anything?

776
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:04,498
Just give me the files.

777
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:10,621
You wanted to see me?

778
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:14,207
I wanted to give credit
where credit is due.

779
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:15,459
Cahill went for it.

780
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:17,210
Yes,

781
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:20,681
and when he finds nothing,
we'll be done with him.

782
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:21,882
Good job.

783
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:25,302
Thank you.

784
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,272
And thank you
for taking me back,

785
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,036
especially since I know
you didn't want to.

786
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:32,142
Would you have wanted
to if you were me?

787
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,478
I did just come up
with that fix.

788
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:39,650
A fix for Cahill coming after
you for colluding with Harvey?

789
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:44,821
A problem I never would have had
if I'd never met you.

790
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:46,290
Why'd you call me down here?

791
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:49,293
I want to know
why the hell you came back.

792
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,580
You know, it's funny. If you'd
asked me that this morning,

793
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:55,916
I would have said because I had
no place else to go.

794
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:58,218
I didn't ask you this morning.

795
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:01,388
I'm asking you now.

796
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:05,509
Then it doesn't matter
why I came back.

797
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:08,645
What matters is that I'm staying

798
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,648
because this is where I belong.

799
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:23,193
Hey, just the person
I was looking for.

800
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,278
- You heard?
- I heard that I just

801
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,414
booked a plane ticket
to Boston to surprise Sheila,

802
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,199
and I need you to cover
the McBain hearing tomorrow.

803
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:33,704
Louis, the McBain hearing
is the least of our worries.

804
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,372
What do you mean?

805
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:38,041
Harvey went to court
this morning and agreed to hand

806
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:41,044
over every single document
on the Gillis takeover,

807
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,429
including Forstman.

808
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:45,265
What?
Why would--

809
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:48,435
Because he thinks
we have nothing to hide.

810
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:52,606
Shit.
Then it's only a matter of time

811
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:54,024
before I'm marched
out of here in handcuffs.

812
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,225
I'm not gonna
let it come to that.

813
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,027
Oh, how the hell
are you gonna stop it?

814
00:35:57,145 --> 00:36:01,031
By replacing one document
with another.

815
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:02,899
I am not framing Harvey.

816
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,786
This isn't framing Harvey.

817
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:08,321
It's freeing you.
What are you talking about?

818
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:10,006
This makes it look
like Forstman's payment never

819
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,109
went to any offshore accounts

820
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,690
and that you never took a piece
of it.

821
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:16,413
No, that's forgery.

822
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:22,135
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

823
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:23,587
I didn't ask you to do this.

824
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:26,223
Then don't use it,

825
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:28,508
but you're the one who said that
if we give them those files,

826
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,594
it's only a matter of time.

827
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:34,431
Louis, Cahill's looking for dirt
on Harvey and Mike,

828
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,433
not you and Forstman.

829
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,151
He won't even give this
a second glance.

830
00:36:38,302 --> 00:36:40,103
But if he does,
it puts Harvey in jeopardy,

831
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:44,991
and I might as well frame him
just like Forstman wanted me to.

832
00:36:45,142 --> 00:36:47,160
Then you have a decision
to make because they're turning

833
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:50,163
everything over
first thing tomorrow.

834
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:10,967
Louis, is everything okay?

835
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,970
Yeah, everything's fine, Mike.

836
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:28,201
Donna?

837
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:29,953
What can I do for you, Harvey?

838
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:31,822
Everything taken care of
for the file transfer tomorrow?

839
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,157
It was taken care of 20
minutes before you asked for it.

840
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,326
Great. Here's Howard, Miller,
and Klein.

841
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:37,878
I'd like to get a jump
on these right now.

842
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:39,830
Oh, it's late, Harvey.
We've had a long day.

843
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:41,331
Maybe we can just--
come on.

844
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:43,750
We can order from that shity
Thai place you love.

845
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:45,335
Knock this out in two hours.

846
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,889
- Is that an order or a request?
- What are you--

847
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:50,474
I have a date tonight, Harvey,

848
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:53,760
so unless you think we're gonna
lose Howard, Miller, or Klein,

849
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:55,762
I'm leaving.

850
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,850
Have a good night.

851
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:03,019
Thanks, Harvey.

852
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:04,070
Don't forget to use
protection--

853
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:05,238
Stop right there.

854
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:07,023
Oh, so when I go out
with someone,

855
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:08,992
you can give me all the shit
in the world, but when you do--

856
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,495
Yep. That's exactly
how it works.

857
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,366
Get used to it.

858
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:18,502
What's wrong with you? You
look like you just saw a ghost.

859
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,036
I feel like I did.

860
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:21,891
I think we have a problem.
What do you mean?

861
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:23,077
We just took step number one

862
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,925
to finally putting
this Cahill bullshit behind us.

863
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:27,511
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I don't think it is behind us.

864
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,963
- What?
- I don't know what Louis did,

865
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,548
but I think
he did something wrong.

866
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:32,883
What are you talking about?

867
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:35,218
When he came to me yesterday,
he was chomping at the bit

868
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:36,970
to help fight Cahill.
That's Louis.

869
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:38,984
He'd take a bullet for
this firm, you know that.

870
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:41,391
Then why did he immediately
change his tune after I told him

871
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,394
that Logan was only
releasing our communications?

872
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:45,562
He seemed relieved?

873
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:47,063
He seemed ecstatic,

874
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:49,533
and before that, he was pissed
that I was working on your stuff

875
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,202
until he found out
it was to fight Cahill.

876
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,404
What exactly are you
thinking he might have done?

877
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:55,789
I don't know exactly,

878
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,627
but I think he cut some sort
of deal with Forstman.

879
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:01,711
He did cut a deal
with Forstman.

880
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:03,046
I'm talking about
an illegal deal.

881
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,582
Mike,
I know Forstman's a snake,

882
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,083
but this is Louis
you're talking about.

883
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:09,169
I know, but you weren't there
when he made me that offer.

884
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,837
I'd never seen him like that.

885
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:14,007
He was desperate to keep me
from working for "that man."

886
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:15,258
- Mike--
- And then on top of that,

887
00:39:15,426 --> 00:39:17,727
I found out what he gave up
to get me back here.

888
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:20,430
Sheila.

889
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:24,434
But why would he care about us
handling over everything

890
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:27,270
if he didn't care about
the communications between us?

891
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:29,522
Because if he did make
a dirty deal with Forstman,

892
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,258
it wouldn't have been
in those documents.

893
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,744
It would have been
in the other documents.

894
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,413
The documents
we just told the court

895
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,115
we're happy to turn over.

896
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,834
What are you gonna do?

897
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:43,336
I'm gonna find out
what the hell Louis did.

898
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,340
Go home, Mike.

899
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,343
There's nothing
you can do tonight.

900
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:55,955
I made a huge mistake.

901
